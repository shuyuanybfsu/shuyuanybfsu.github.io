	<left><strong>What is a VPN?</strong></left>
     <p>VPN encrypts and masks your Internet activity, it helps you:</p>
	<p><strong>Surf anonymously: </strong>A VPN hides your online identity so you can surf the web anonymously, which is supported by a number of strict protocols. Your IP address is a total secret and you can browse online without being tracked. The setup is easy on any online connected device.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy secure Wi-fi anywhere: </strong>The widespread Wi-fi connectivity comes with a risk as people using the same network can easily hack unprotected users. That's why Astrill VPN allows anybody to join a hotel, coffee shop, bank, airport or any other public network without the risk of being hacked.</p>
    <p><strong>Bypass censorship: </strong>Get access to filtered or blocked online content without any restriction. Astrill VPN allows you to bypass censorship in any country whether you are traveling or living there.</p>
    <p><strong>Videos and apps from anywhere: </strong>Astrill VPN allows all videos and applications to go through a VPN tunnel, therefore you are able to view any content without geographical limitations.</p>
